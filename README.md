ðŸ“Š Advertising Sales Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression
This project builds a Multiple Linear Regression model from scratch (without using any ML libraries like scikit-learn) to predict product sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

Key Highlights:

Cleaned and preprocessed the Advertising.csv dataset.

Normalized features for better gradient descent convergence.

Implemented cost function, gradient computation, and gradient descent manually.

Visualized feature relationships and training convergence.

Evaluated model performance using R-squared (RÂ²) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metrics.

Provided an option for users to input custom advertising budgets and predict sales.

Final Model Results:

RÂ² Score: 0.90

MAPE: 13.88%

Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
